# Start using Maxthon

## New tab: Excitments within reach

Maxthon sets up some commonly used links in the new tab page, which can be modified or deleted by hovering the mouse over them. You can also group or rearrange the links by dragging them. In the new tab page, you can participate in check-in activities, search, check the weather, change the background, and customize the display style you like.

- [Folder]: When you drag a quick access icon and overlap it with another icon, a folder is automatically created for the two quick access icons. The folder will be automatically deleted when the last quick access icon is dragged out or deleted to 0 files. You can also set the name of the folder after it is opened.
- [New Quick Access]: Click the plus icon at the end of the tag to add a new quick access link, which will be added to the end by default.
- [Set New Tab Page]: Click the "Settings" button in the lower right corner to change the background of the new tab page or upload a local image as the background. You can customize the functional modules displayed in the new tab, the style of the search box, and the display style of the quick access icons, etc.

## Search Everything in the Address Bar

The address bar automatically matches and processes both URLs and search keywords. Maxthon's unified search and address bar can give you matching suggestions based on existing bookmarks, tags, history, open tabs, and search popularity. You can also change the default search engine by setting it or switch in the default search box in the new tab page.
